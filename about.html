    <h1 id="tagviewer">TagViewer</h1>
    <p>TagViewer is a simple program that allows viewing of media within a TagSpace, and rich filtering of that media with tags and properties that are stored by the program. You can also sort by values of properties or presence of tags, as well as show the media in a slideshow.</p>
    <h4 id="youshouldusetagviewerif">You should use TagViewer if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a large repository of media that can be categorized in multiple ways</li>
      <li>You don't want to commit to one sorting hierarchy</li>
      <li>You find yourself looking through multiple directories for media that are in the same logical category</li>
      <li>You want to be able to store properties of the media</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="youshouldnotusetagviewerif">You should not use TagViewer if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Your media has one fixed system of sorting that you are satisfied with</li>
      <li>There is only one way to sort your media</li>
      <li>The directory hierarchy you already have works well for you</li>
      <li>Extra metadata isn't important or necessary for your use case</li>
      <li>You don't like Node/Electron apps (which is a valid stance, but I'm a web developer by trade so the Web 3 are just what I'm familiar with)</li>
    </ul>
